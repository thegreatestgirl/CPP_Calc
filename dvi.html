    <h3>About SmartCalc_v1.0</h3>
    <p>This program is my analog of popular app: calculator. It contains unary plus and minus, all basic arithmetic
        operations:
        plus, minus, multiply, divide. Also, this calculator supports some math functions: sqrt, ln (natural logarithm),
        log
        (decimal logarithm). And SmartCalc_v1.0 keeps trigonometric functions: cos(), sin(), tan(), acos(), asin(),
        atan(). I also added Pi const
        (p at app) and exponent form (for exm. 3e+8).</p>
